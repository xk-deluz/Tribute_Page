        <h1 id="info-title2">Who Is Claudette Colvin?</h1>
        <p>Claudette Colvin is a civil rights activist who at the age of 15 and before Rosa 
Parks, refused to give up her seat to a white woman on a crowded, segregated bus. She
was arrested and became one of four plaintiffs in Browder v. Gayle, which ruled that the segregated bus sytem in Montgomery was unconstitutional. Colvin later moved to New York City and worked as a nurse's aide. She retired in 2004.</p>

        <h1 id="info-title3">Bus Incident</h1>
        <p>In 1955, Colvin was a student at the segregated Booker T. Washington High School and she relied on the city's buses to get to and from school. If the buses became over crowded and all the "white seats" in the front of the bus were filled, any African Americans seated was supposed to get up to make room for whites. When a white woman got on the bus and was left standing, the bus driver, Robert W. Cleere, demanded Colvin and three other black women in her row move to the back. She refused. Once the police arrived, Colvin still refused to move. She was eventually arrested, while being escorted to the station by police officers,they made sexual comments about her body and took turns guessing her bra size throughout the ride. Colvin was initially charged with disturbing the peace, violating the segregation laws, and battering and assaulting a police officer. She was convicted on all three charges in juvenile court. Colvin's case was appealed on May 6, 1955, charges of disturbing the peace/violating the segregation laws were dropped, her conviction for assaulting a police 
officer was upheld.</p>
